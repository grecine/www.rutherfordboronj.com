On February 8, 2021 the Mayor and Council adopted Resolution No. 52 which authorizes the Planning Board to conduct a preliminary investigation to determine whether properties – Block 73 Lots 5.02, 6, 20.01, 22 and 22.01 on Chestnut Street and
Park Avenue constitute a non-condemnation area in need of redevelopment. 

The aforementioned properties are all owned by Vango Holdings, LLC, the current owners of the Parker. The Planning Board has yet to begin this process.
