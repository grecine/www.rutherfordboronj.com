  The Rutherford Community/Quality of Life Committee was founded in 2009.  As its name implies, the Community/Quality of Life Committee is comprised of residents seeking to strengthen the Borough’s sense of community, as well as its quality of life.  Highlights of the committee’s work since its inception include: Sponsoring two Club Fairs to encourage residents to become involved and make positive contributions to our Borough. Sponsoring the Summer Reading in Lincoln Park program, in partnership with the Rutherford Public Library and Rutherford Recreation staff.   Initiating an Outstanding Citizen Award program. Hosting an educational forum for Rutherford residents featuring members of Courage to Connect NJ. In February 2016, the Community/Quality of Life Committee welcomed new members of the former Board of Aesthetic Review
