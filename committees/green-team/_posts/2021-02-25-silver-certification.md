---

Sustainable Jersey representatives announced that Rutherford has met the rigorous requirements to achieve Sustainable Jersey Silver-level]  certification.  Rutherford is one of is one of 55 towns that have attained certification in 2020 and will be honored at the Sustainable Jersey Virtual Awards Luncheon on Thursday, March 11, 2021. Sustainable Jersey's participating communities represent over 81 percent of the state's municipalities.  

“Achieving Sustainable Jersey silver-level certification was a team effort of the Borough Council, Departments of Public Works, Health, and Recreation, the Rutherford Police Department, the Green Team, the Shade Tree Commission, the Rutherford Arts Council, and the residents and businesses of Rutherford.” said Mayor Frank Nunziato.  “We look forward to continuing these initiatives and implementing new ones to build a more sustainable Rutherford.”

To become Sustainable Jersey certified at the silver-level, Rutherford submitted documentation to show it had completed a balance of the required sustainability actions, meeting a minimum of 350 action points.  In addition to reaching 350 points, each community had to create a green team and select at least three out of twelve priority action options. Rutherford did three of the twelve priority actions by completing 1) prescription drug safety and disposal, 2) recycling and waste reduction education and compliance, and 3) a sustainable land use pledge.

Eileen Eastham, thanks fellow Green Team Co-chair, Julia Siegel, for her role in attaining this Silver-level Sustainable Jersey Award. She stated, “Julia Siegel’s understanding of the application process and persistence were basic to the success of this award. Thank you, also, to our council liaison, Maria Begg-Roberson, for her constant support. “

“With nearly 90 percent of the New Jersey population living in a Sustainable Jersey community, we know our work at Sustainable Jersey has never been more important,” said Randall Solomon, executive director of Sustainable Jersey. “Congratulations to the municipalities that achieved certification in a very challenging year. Your hard work brings us closer to the goal of a sustainable New Jersey.”

 Rutherford, also known as the Borough of Trees, has a rich history of environmental awareness. The Borough has worked for generations to preserve its tree canopy and is excited to embrace new ways the community can practice environmentally sustainability.
