   The mission of the Rutherford Civil Rights Commission is to eliminate discrimination, increase public awareness of civil rights through advocacy and education, provide information and referrals, and offer conflict resolution services and mediation for civil rights matters. The Commission envisions Rutherford as a community that fosters dignity, respect, understanding, and acceptance of all citizens. The Commission holds a yearly Multicultural Festival as well.
