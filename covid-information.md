# COVID-19 Information

[**Announcement of 55 Kip Center Closing**](/covid-related-closures.md)


March 11th, 2020

Message from Mayor Frank A. Nunziato (March 11th, 2020):

The Borough of Rutherford is continuously working in close collaboration
with State, Federal and local public health partners to closely monitor
circumstances as they develop. There are currently no known confirmed
cases of COVID-19 and no PUI (person under investigation) in the
Borough of Rutherford and the risk of community transmission is
low. However, Public Health Officials are urging members of the public to
begin preparing for the possibility of a broader outbreak in the United
States. Everyone needs to take the necessary steps to prepare in the
event that a broader outbreak occurs.

State and Federal Officials are also prompting members of the public to
begin to develop contingency plans for work, school, and home in the
event that an outbreak occurs in our community. While the risk of an
outbreak remains low, now is the time for families, educators, and
employers to begin preparing for the possibility of an interruption to
everyday life in the event of an outbreak.

Some recommended steps include:

- Discuss with your employer if telecommuting/working from home
options are available in the event of an outbreak.

- Store a two-week supply of water and food.

- Periodically check your regular prescription drugs to ensure a three-
month supply in your home.

- Have any non-prescription drugs and other health supplies on hand,
including pain relievers, stomach remedies, cough and cold medicines,
fluids with electrolytes, and vitamins.

Clinical presentation of confirmed cases of COVID-19 have ranged from
mild symptoms to severe illness and death. Symptoms include fever,
cough, and shortness of breath. 

**It is important to reiterate that at this time, the CDC maintains that for the general American public, the immediate
health risk from coronavirus is considered low.**

If you are experiencing symptoms following possible exposure to COVID-
19, seek medical care as soon as possible. Remember to call ahead and
tell the healthcare provider’s office about your recent travel, symptoms,
and concerns. Please also avoid close contact with others while ill and
avoid travel.

Anyone with questions about the novel coronavirus, symptoms, or their risk
of exposure, can call the free, New Jersey 24-hour public hotline at 1-800-
222-1222

Currently, there is no treatment or vaccine available to treat or prevent
COVID-19, but the best way to protect yourself from contracting or
spreading viruses is to follow good, common hygiene practices that
include:

- Frequent hand washing w/ soap &amp; water, or use alcohol-based
hand sanitizer if no access to water.

- Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue or sleeve when coughing
or sneezing

- Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.

- Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

- If you are sick, stay home from work or school.

Flu activity remains high in NJ, and it is not too late to get the Flu shot!
The influenza vaccine does not protect against any coronavirus
infection, but it can help keep you healthy during the flu season.
