As you are cleaning out this spring, donâ€™t forget about fire safety.

* Test your smoke alarms, and replace any alarms that are 10 years old or older.
* Test your carbon monoxide alarms, and replace any alarms that are 7 years old or older.
* Check your dryer vents and clean the hosing.
* Clean clutter inside and outside your home.
* Check the cords on your appliances. If any are cracked or frayed, repair or replace them.
* Practice your home fire escape plan.
