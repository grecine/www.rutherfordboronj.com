title: Santa Claus Is Coming to Town – Sat. Dec. 10!
---

Santa had such a great time at Rutherford’s Holiday Parade & Festival that he’ll be returning to participate in the Rutherford Fire Department’s annual “Santa on the Fire Truck” Day. 

**Fire Department volunteers plan to drive Santa around Rutherford beginning at 1 p.m.** 

Santa can’t wait to see you tomorrow! Please be sure to give him a warm Rutherford welcome! Thank you to the Rutherford Fire Department for continuing this special holiday tradition!
