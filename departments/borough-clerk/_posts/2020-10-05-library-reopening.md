We are pleased to announce that the Rutherford Public Library is re-opening with limited services today, Monday, Oct. 5, at 10am. We are excited to invite our patrons back into the library for browsing, borrowing and computer use. For the time being, we will be open the following hours:

Monday and Wednesday, 10am - 1pm; 5 - 7pm

Tuesday, Thursday, & Friday, 10am - 1pm; 3-5pm

We will be continually assessing the situation and will keep the community informed if and when our hours change. We expect to be able to open on Saturdays soon. Please note that we plan to close at 1pm each day so we can further sanitize the building.

The library will continue to offer Grab & Go doorside pickup for those who cannot come during our open building hours or who would prefer not to enter the building. The hours for that service will remain the same as they currently are:

Monday and Wednesday, 3 - 7pm

Tuesday, Thursday, & Friday, 1 - 5pm

During the library closure, staff was still working hard:

·    Our digital content was heavily used: During the time we were closed from March through August, we checked out almost 5,700 ebooks and e-audiobooks.

·    Our children's Summer Reading Club went virtual this year, kicking off in May and continuing through September. We had 319 registrants and they read 11,280 books.

·    We connected online with 115 patrons through email, Facebook, and Zoom with our "The Librarian Is In!" Program.

·    Our Grab & Go service kicked off at the end of June, and we checked out nearly 27,000 items to our patrons.

·    We created the Library @ Home blog, helping you learn about your family history, tools you can use for free courtesy of the library, the virtual happenings worth your time, adjusting to new technology, and keeping your finances in order.

·    We provided our own virtual programming for both children and adults. From March through August, we had over 6,000 video views and 550 participants.
