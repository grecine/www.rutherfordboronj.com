Route 3 overnight lane closures needed for beam installation on Ridge Road Bridge over Route 3 in Rutherford

Temporary 15-minute closures needed at night for two weeks for beam installation


(Trenton) – New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) officials today announced temporary 15-minute overnight lane closures of Route 3 in both directions for the next two weeks for the installation of beams for the new Ridge Road Bridge over Route 3 in Rutherford.

From 10 p.m. until 5 a.m. each night, beginning tonight, Tuesday, September 10 through Friday, September 13, and again Monday, September 16 through Friday, September 20, NJDOT’s contractor, Carbro Contractors Corp., will be temporarily closing Route 3 in both directions for 15-minutes to allow for the installation of new beams for the Ridge Road Bridge over Route 3. New Jersey State Police will be on site to control traffic. Motorists are advised to stay alert and slow down through the construction zone.

The federally-funded $26.7 million project began in March 2018 and will replace both the Ridge Road Bridge and the Orient Way Bridge over Route 3, provide a continuous full-width right shoulder on Route 3 in both directions to help ease congestion, and make improvements to the Polito Avenue and Rutherford Avenue intersection, including traffic signal improvements and ADA compliant sidewalk ramps. 

The project is being constructed in five stages and NJDOT is using Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC) techniques to reduce the time it will take to replace the bridges. The entire project is expected to be completed by the fall of 2020. As the Ridge Road and Orient Way Bridges over Route 3 project advances, NJDOT will provide additional information including ramp or lane closures and detours.

The precise timing of the work is subject to change due to weather or other factors.
