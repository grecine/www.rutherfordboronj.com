**Rutherford WWI Centennial Committee Veterans Panel Unveiling**

**April 6, 2017**

**4:00PM**

**Rutherford Borough Hall**


The Borough of Rutherford's World War I Centennial Committee will kick off the centennial remembrance period on April 6, 2017 with the first of several planned events during the coming months. This date marks the 100th anniversary of the US Declaration of War against Imperial Germany and our entry into World War I. The Committee will unveil its first in a monthly series of panels honoring Rutherford veterans of the Great War. 

Each month during the centennial period (April 2017 to November 2018) a Rutherford veteranâ€™s story will be told. It is hoped that these stories of bravery will both educate and inspire Borough citizens. The unveiling will take place in Borough Hall at 4PM with both Mayor Joseph DeSalvo and Borough Council members as honored guests.
