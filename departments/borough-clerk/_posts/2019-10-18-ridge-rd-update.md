NJDOT Traffic Advisory -- Route 3 overnight lane closures for a week needed to allow for work under the Ridge Road Bridge over Route 3 in Rutherford

(Trenton) – New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) officials today announced overnight lane
closures on Route 3 in both directions for the next week to install shielding and relocate utilities under the
new Ridge Road Bridge over Route 3 in Rutherford.


From 10 p.m. until 5 a.m. the next morning, beginning tonight, Friday, October 18 and continuing
weeknights, Monday through Friday, October 25, NJDOT’s contractor, Carbro Contractors Corp., will be
temporarily closing two lanes on Route 3 in each directions to install shielding under the new Ridge Road
Bridge over Route 3 and relocate utilities. At least one lane will be maintained overnight.


The federally-funded $26.7 million project began in March 2018 and will replace both the Ridge Road
Bridge and the Orient Way Bridge over Route 3, provide a continuous full-width right shoulder on Route 3
in both directions to help ease congestion, and make improvements to the Polito Avenue and Rutherford
Avenue intersection, including traffic signal improvements and ADA compliant sidewalk ramps.


The project is being constructed in five stages and NJDOT is using Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC)
techniques to reduce the time it will take to replace the bridges. The entire project is expected to be
completed by the fall of 2020. As the Ridge Road and Orient Way Bridges over Route 3 project advances,
NJDOT will provide additional information including ramp or lane closures and detours.


The precise timing of the work is subject to change due to weather or other factors. Motorists are
encouraged to check NJDOT’s traffic information website www.511nj.org for real-time travel information
