2020 Municipal Election Information – July 7 Primary

[Borough Clerk's Information on Voter Registration Here](/departments/borough-clerk/election-voter-info/)

On Tuesday, July 7th, voters will cast ballots for their party candidates for President of the United States, US Senate, Congress, Freeholders, and local
candidates. It is up to each and every American Citizen to exercise their right to vote.

In light of the Coronavirus Pandemic and Executive Order No. 144, ALL DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN REGISTERED VOTERS AUTOMATICALLY RECEIVED A VOTE-BY-MAIL BALLOT for the Primary Election. 

If an Unaffiliated or Inactive Status Voter would like to participate in the Primary they should’ve
completed and return the Vote-by-Mail Application that was sent to them.

If you have a disability and need an accessible ballot, please contact (201) 336-7020 or you may go to your assigned polling place identified on your sample ballot. There
you will be provided instructions to access to an in-person accessible voting device.

The ADA compliant Voting Machine is only for voters who have a disability.

Should you choose not to vote on a Mail-In Ballot and show up to one of the limited number of Polling Places on Election Day, only Provisional Paper Ballots will be
available to cast your vote.
