PSEG has begun work in the borough installing 69KV lines within the right-of-way along several borough streets. The council formally requested a revised plan be considered which would have redirected some of the poles to the south of Route 3 but that request was denied by PSEG.

For more information please read the documents provided by PSEG below:
