title: "Section 2A Automated Recycling"
---

As the Borough of Rutherford transitions to fully automated recycling, recycling carts will be distributed. On or about March 28, 2016, residents in 
Section 2A (Passaic Ave N/S â€“ Union Ave S/S) will receive a blue recycling cart. This cart is to be used upon receipt exclusively for single stream 
recycling (bottles, cans, paper, and cardboard together).
