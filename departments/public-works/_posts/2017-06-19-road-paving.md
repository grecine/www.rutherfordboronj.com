title: "Paving Lincoln and Wheaton Avenues 6/19"
---

**The paving of Lincoln and Wheaton Avenues is scheduled to occur today and tomorrow.**

Weather permitting the paving should be completed by Tuesday, June 20th.  

The 2017 municipal road program will then shift operations to the entire length of Morse Avenue and begin with curb replacement.  Area residents will be noticed in advance of the work with the specific start time and which side of the street will be impacted first. Please also check here for updated information.   Other remaining concrete work from the 2016 road program will also be completed at this time.
