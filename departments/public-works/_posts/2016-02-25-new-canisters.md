title: "Section 1B Automated Recycling"
---

As the Borough of Rutherford transitions to fully automated recycling, recycling carts will be distributed. On or about February 29, 2016, residents in Section 1B (Pierrepont Ave N/S â€“ Passaic Ave S/S) will receive a blue recycling cart. This cart is to be used exclusively for single stream recycling (bottles, cans, paper, and cardboard together).
