Athletes, Injuries and Pain: A Discussion of Alternatives to Opioids

In Partnership with the NJ Attorney General's Office and the Rutherford Police Department

**September 6th, 7-8:30pm**

**Rutherford High School**

**56 Elliott Place**

Acting Bergen County Prosecutor Dennis Calo announces the second in a series
of quarterly Community Conversations to be held in Bergen County. Members of the
community are invited to attend a town hall meeting titled “Athletes, Injuries, and Pain: A
Discussion of Alternatives to Opioids” on Thursday, September 6, 2018 at Rutherford
High School.

The meeting, which will be co-hosted with the New Jersey Attorney General’s
Office and the Rutherford Police Department, is part of a statewide initiative called the
21/21 Community Policing Project, which New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal
created in order to strengthen relationships between law enforcement officers and the
communities they serve. Parents, coaches, teachers, and residents throughout the
county are encouraged to attend. “This forum is an educational opportunity for students,
parents, coaches, teachers, and the general public to learn about the potential and severe
dangers of opioid abuse by student athletes who may be injured in their sports and require
pain management for their injuries,” said Acting Prosecutor Calo.

In addition to Attorney General Grewal, Acting Prosecutor Calo, and Rutherford
Police Chief John R. Russo, other presenters include Dr. Randy Tartacoff and Shelley
Stuart. Dr. Randy Tartacoff, MD, FACEP, has been in practice for more than 30 years.
He holds a number of titles, including Co-Director of the Emergency Department of Holy
Name Medical Center and Adjunct Clinical Professor of Emergency Medicine at Touro
College of Osteopathic Medicine. Shelley Stuart is the Director of Coalition and
Community Services at The Center for Alcohol and Drug Resources.

Future topics of these quarterly gatherings will be:

Fall – Immigration Enforcement

Winter – Bias Crimes.

The September 6 meeting is open to the public and will be held from 7:00 p.m. to
8:30 p.m. in the Auditorium at Rutherford High School, 56 Elliott Place, Rutherford, New
Jersey.
