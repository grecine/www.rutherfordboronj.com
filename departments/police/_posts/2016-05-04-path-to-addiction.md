Please attend this seminar pertaining to drug abuse.  A must for parents of students.

Many people turn to heroin after "liking" the feeling of prescription pain killers or opiates such as Oxycodone and Percoset.

We are a are a society that does not want pain and wants something to "fix it." You have dental work or a car accident and you receive pills. This is where heroin addiction begins.
