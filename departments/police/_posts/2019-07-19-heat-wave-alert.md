As temperatures creep higher and closer to the 100 degrees expected on Saturday, July
20, 2019, Bergen County announced it is opening designated cooling centers to help
residents beat the heat.

The following location has been designated as a Bergen County cooling center and will be
open to the public in our area:

Southwest Bergen Senior Activity Center

Telephone number: 201-935-8920

Hours of operation: 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.;

Should there be a loss of power in the Borough for an extended duration, the Borough of
Rutherford will attempt to open 2 cooling centers which will be open to Borough residents
and staffed by Borough emergency personnel. The availability of the 2 Rutherford cooling
centers will be announced via our webpage, social media outlets and reverse 9-1-1 calls to
landline telephone numbers, once the decision to open has been made. The center
locations are as follows:


1) The Kip Center – 55 Kip Avenue

A heat wave is an extended period of extreme heat, and is often accompanied by high
humidity. These conditions can be dangerous and even life-threatening for humans who
don't take the proper precautions.

Excessive Heat Preparedness:

Heat kills by pushing the human body beyond its limits. In extreme heat and high humidity,
evaporation is slowed and the body must work extra hard to maintain a normal
temperature.

Most heat disorders occur because the victim has been overexposed to heat or has over-
exercised for his or her age and physical condition. Older adults, young children and those who are sick or overweight are more likely to succumb to extreme heat.
What you should do if the weather is extremely hot:

• NEVER LEAVE CHILDREN OR PETS ALONE IN CLOSED VEHICLES.

• Stay indoors as much as possible and limit exposure to the sun.

• Stay on the lowest floor out of the sunshine if air conditioning is not available.

• Eat well-balanced, light, and regular meals.

• Drink plenty of water; even if you do not feel thirsty.

• Provide fresh clean water to pets.

• Limit intake of alcoholic beverages.

• Dress in loose-fitting, lightweight, and light-colored clothes that cover as much skin
as possible.

• Avoid dark colors because they absorb the sun’s rays.

• Protect face and head by wearing a wide-brimmed hat.

• Avoid strenuous work during the warmest part of the day. Use a buddy system
when working in extreme heat, and take frequent breaks, in the shade if possible.

• Check on your animals frequently to ensure that they are not suffering from the
heat. Remember if you’re hot, so is your pet, so keep them cool and hydrated as
well.

• Avoid walking on and keep pets off of hot dark asphalt.

Check on family, friends, neighbors and especially the elderly who are at risk, who do not
have air conditioning and who spend much of their time alone
Please remain safe during this time of high heat.
