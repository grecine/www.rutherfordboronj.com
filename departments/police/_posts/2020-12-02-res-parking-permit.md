RESIDENTIAL PARKING PERMIT EXTENSION INFORMATION

All current residential parking permits that expire at yearâ€™s end 2020 will be extended through 12-31-21.

No new tags or alterations will be needed for valid permits issued. * Newly issued license plates and transfer of license plates require a new application.

Due to COVID-19 and the fact that we now handle many of our calls for service inside our lobby, we would like to remind you of the need to limit individuals in our building for the safety of our community and staff. Please e-mail all Residential Parking Program applications, including new and modifications for a switch of vehicles, and questions to traffic@rutherfordpd.com
