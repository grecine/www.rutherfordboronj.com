**STOP THE BLEED, SAVE A LIFE! - Learn proper Trauma Care Response From The Pros**

When serious injuries are suffered, the first few minutes immediately following the incident are often the
most critical. Minutes, even seconds count, particularly when there is substantial bleeding.
Bystanders can have a lasting impact as they are the first on the scene.

STOP THE BLEED is a FREE, nationwide training campaign to teach bystanders life-saving techniques such as
how to apply a pressure bandage and use a tourniquet. Youâ€™ll be taught proper Trauma Care Response.

Join members of Rutherford Recreation, Rutherford Police Department and
Rutherford Volunteer Ambulance Corp. for this FREE training from
Hackensack University Medical Center and learn how you can help save a life!
