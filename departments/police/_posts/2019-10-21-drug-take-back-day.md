This Prescription Drug Take Back Day in Rutherford, NJ addresses a crucial public safety and public health issue. Did you know that 9.9 million Americans misused controlled prescription drugs, according to the 2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. The study shows that a majority of abused prescription drugs were not obtained from drug dealers, but rather from family and friends. Often times without their knowledge from the home medicine cabinet.

The DEAâ€™s Take Back Day events provide an opportunity for Americans to prevent drug addiction and overdose deaths. Too often, unused prescription drugs find their way into the wrong hands. That's dangerous and often tragic. That's why it was great to see thousands of folks from across the country clean out their medicine cabinets and turn in - safely and anonymously - a record amount of prescription drugs.
