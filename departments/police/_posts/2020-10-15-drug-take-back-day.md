Once again, the Rutherford Police Department will be participating in the annual DEAâ€™s National Rx Take Back Day event. This event provides an opportunity for Americans to prevent drug addiction and overdose deaths. The prescription pill collection initiative will be held on Saturday, October 24, 2020 from 10 A.M. to 2 P.M. inside of our main lobby located at 184 Park Avenue, side door on Donaldson Avenue.

This DEA sponsored initiative provides our residents an opportunity to safely dispose of unwanted, unused and expired prescription medications in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. We cannot accept liquids, needles or sharps, only pills or patches. We will accept e-cigarettes without the battery. The service is free and anonymous, no questions asked.

Secure all prescription pills in a clear plastic bag, Ziploc or similar, prior to responding to our headquarters.

To maintain a healthy Rutherford, social distancing must be obeyed. Only one person may enter our lobby at time. That person must have a mask on properly. And you must maintain a minimum of six feet from one another outside IF a line forms.

Questions, call Sergeant Julie Ann Zeigler at 201-460-3054 prior to the day of the event.
