---

As of May 1, 2017 the credit card convenience fee charged for the use of a credit card in the payment of taxes will increase from 2.45% of the total payment to 2.65% of the payment. (The minimum fee is $3.00 per transaction). This fee is collected and retained by the 3rd party facilitator.
The $1.00 convenience fee for using your checking account ( ACH payment, or “e-check”) will remain the same.
