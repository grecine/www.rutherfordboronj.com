   The Rutherford Public Library offers a wide variety of materials for children, teens, and adults including books, magazines, music, movies, large print books, and foreign language (Spanish and Korean) materials.  The Library has the largest reference collection–books and journals for in-house use–in southern Bergen County, and issues of the Rutherford newspapers are available on microfilm from 1905 – the current year.
