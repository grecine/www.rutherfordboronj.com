**On July 23, there will be a collection to benefit the Rutherford Community Pantry at Lincoln Park from 10:30 a.m. â€“ 1:00 p.m.**
 
The Murphy Harvest is a family effort initiated by the children of Don and Rose Murphy to keep the Rutherford Community Food Pantry full for Summer months when it is most neglected, while keeping the spirit of their parents alive in the community.
 
Collections will be accepted through July 23 at 67 W. Pierrepont Avenue, Rutherford. 
 
Donations made out to the Rutherford Food Pantry will also be accepted. Please mail checks to Attn: Cox/Murphy Family, 64 Mercer St., Wallington, NJ 07057.
 
As a reminder, the Food Pantry may not accept perishable items or items with expired dates.
