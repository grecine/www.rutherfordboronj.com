**2017 Downhill Derby**

Saturday, June 17th 11:00 am - 8:00 pm 

414 Montross Ave. Rutherford NJ

Watch as kids and adults use science and engineering concepts to design, build and race gravity powered race carts. Competitors were challenged to come up with a cart design that will not only be fast, but can actually be built and look good. Come see what they've built and cheer on your favorite cart.
