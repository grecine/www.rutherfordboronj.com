Good Luck to RHS Boys Varsity Soccer!  Thank you, Coach Randazzo!

Thank you to Rutherford High School Boys Varsity Soccer Coach John Randazzo for conducting a Clinic for Rutherford Rec Soccer Coaches and for being so generous with your time and willingness to continue to serve as a resource.

Best of luck to your members of the RHS Boys Varsity Soccer team in their game against defending Group 2 State Champs, Garfield, at 7 p.m. tonight at Tryon Field!

Rutherfordians, come out and show your support!
