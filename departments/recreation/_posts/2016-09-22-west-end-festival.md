The Borough of Rutherford will host its 8th annual West End Fall Family Festival on Saturday, September 24 from 11 a.m. - 5p.m. to celebrate and promote our West End and its businesses, restaurants and organizations.

Bring your family and friends to enjoy wonderful live entertainment by Rutherford's own Luke and the Troublemakers Band, fresh off their recent performances in Rutherford's Lincoln Park.

Come with an appetite to support our West End restaurants. And be sure to support our West End Firehouse Firefighters, home of West End Engine & Hose Co. 3 and Rutherford Fire/Rescue Co. 5. Hot dogs, shish kebabs, pretzels and soda are planned for their menu.

As always, a variety of free rides and amusements will be offered for children.

Please be sure to also stop by and support Rutherford organizations, enjoy shopping and West End services.

**Special thanks to our event co-sponsor, the Meadowlands Area YMCA, and Event Producer, Cliffhanger Productions. Thank you to all sponsors, including Century 21 Eudan Realty, Boiling Springs Savings Bank, and Wallington Shop Rite Inserra Supermarkets, Inc.**

Mayor Joe DeSalvo and Council members would also like to thank our Rutherford Department Heads/Executive Secretary and staff for their collaborative work on the many Borough events we offer to our residents.

Please continue to support Rutherford's invigorated West End not only on Saturday, but throughout the year!

*This event is rain or shine.
