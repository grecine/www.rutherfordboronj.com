**TOP DAWGS is a program designed to provide a soccer experience tailored to the needs of children with physical and/or developmental disabilities.**  

Player participation and soccer development in a safe environment are key elements of the program with the ultimate goal of improving the fitness, self-esteem and social skills of all participants. 
The program is administered by volunteers and is sponsored by the Rutherford Recreation Department in partnership with Rutherford FC (the Rutherford Travel Soccer Program).  Rutherford residents only are eligible for the program.
TOP DAWGS is modeled on the TOP Soccer program (The Outreach Program for Soccer) sponsored by US Youth Soccer.  A Parents Guide on this community based program is available on their website at http://www.njyouthsoccer.com.
The goal of the TOP DAWGS program is to be as inclusive as possible.  However, the program may not be able to accommodate applicants in instances where the severity of a disability is beyond the capabilities of the volunteer team to manage safely.  Please contact Trish Boylan (201.835.0006) or Monica Bonner (201.803.6671) if you have questions.
