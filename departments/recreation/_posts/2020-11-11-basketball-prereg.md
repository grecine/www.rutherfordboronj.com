title: Basketball Pre-Registration
---


We are opening a PRE-REGISTRATION for Basketball. 

Due to the unusual circumstances 2020 has provided we will NOT be charging a FEE until we can confirm the season will be able to commence successfully. Please see the attached flyers for more information and the anticipated fees of the programs. More information on travel programs will be released at a later date.

Sign up online at [https://register.communitypass.net/reg/index.cfm](https://register.communitypass.net/reg/index.cfm)

Pre-registered participants will receive first priority for the season due to limited capacity.

We appreciate your patience and understanding as we attempt to create a safe & healthy basketball program for the Rutherford youth.
