KIDSPOT PLAYGROUND WILL BE CLOSED FOR RENOVATIONS

The Borough of Rutherford is proud to announce KIDSPOT Playground renovations will be
starting on Monday, March 12 th with an expected completion date on or around mid-May.
Due to weather constraints and daylight savings, the playground construction must be completed on or around this time.

KIDSPOT playground will be updated with state-of- the-art equipment which will provide a playground for children of all abilities in our Borough.

Please note that the existing Memorial KIDSPOT bricks will be re-installed at the new
playground. The bathrooms will be closed during renovation.

The other playground locations available for play during the renovation are at Wall Field,
Tamblyn Field, Katie’s Corner and the picnic area behind Tryon Field.
We are asking for everyone’s patience and tolerance during this exciting new addition.

Thank you!

The Borough of Rutherford
