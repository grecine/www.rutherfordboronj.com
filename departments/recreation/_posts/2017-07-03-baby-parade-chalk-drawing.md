Residents wishing to participate in the contest portion of the parade are encouraged to decorate their child’s stroller, bike, wagon, etc., with patriotic or other themes.  Parents are also encouraged to have their children dress for the role.  This is a wonderful community event that showcases the artistic talent of parents and the incredible cuteness factor we have here in our Rutherford children.
