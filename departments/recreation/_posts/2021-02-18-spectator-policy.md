title: Spectator Policy at Indoor Rec Games 
---

Last week, Governor Murphy issued an Executive Order allowing municipalities to loosen regulations at indoor sporting events if they are able to adhere to certain capacity and COVID safety guidelines. 

We have assessed our facilities and after taking scheduling and safety protocol into consideration, it has been determined that spectators will NOT be permitted in Rutherford gyms for the remainder of the Recreation basketball season. 
 
Coaches will continue to provide a Zoom link for the remainder of the season so games can be watched virtually.
 
While we know many of you are disappointed, we do not feel this can be accomplished in a safe and fair manner while capacity restrictions exist.
 
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
