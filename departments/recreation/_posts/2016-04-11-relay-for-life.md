In the fight against cancer, silence is the last thing we need. 

Relay for Life of Rutherford is a great place to take action. 

This event symbolizes hope and the goal of ending a disease that threatens the lives of so many people we love. This event is an opportunity to honor survivors, remember those we have lost, and raise funds and awareness to fight back and help cancer research.
