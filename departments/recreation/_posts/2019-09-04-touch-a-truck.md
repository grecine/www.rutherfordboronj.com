Memorial Field 1-3pm

Bring your children to this fun annual event where they’ll be able to climb aboard many trucks and vehicles, including Fire trucks, tow trucks, sanitation vehicles, an ambulance, landscaping trucks and more! Children will also be able to try on firefighter’s boots, honk horns, etc. Please stop by the Rutherford Recreation Department table for fun giveaways, tattoos, coloring and treats.

Thank you to Nick’s Mobil for once again sponsoring this event!
