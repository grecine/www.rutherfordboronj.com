Join us for Rutherford’s third annual Summer Kick-Off/Cruisin’ on the Avenue event!  Enjoy a Classic Car Show that will serve as a fundraiser for the Rutherford Ambulance Corps, Dining Under the Stars, live music by Lifespeed in Lincoln Park, a Rutherford Club Fair, Beer & Wine Gardens along Park Avenue, and games. 
 
The Car Show will feature Classic Cars, Antique Cars, Street Rods, Muscle Cars, Customs and Motorcycles.  Having these cars descend upon Rutherford and parked along Park Avenue is something to see!
 
Registration for cars to be featured in the show will be $15, or $20 on the day of the show.  (Free admission to spectators.)  Giveaways for the first 100 vehicles.  Trophies and awards will also be presented. To register for the Car Show portion of the evening, visit [www.rutherfordems.org](http://www.rutherfordems.org/).
 
The 2016 & 2015 Cruisin’ on the Avenue events were special nights for Rutherford.  Let’s repeat that in 2017!
