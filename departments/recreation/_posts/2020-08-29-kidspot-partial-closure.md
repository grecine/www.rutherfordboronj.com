Please be advised that Kidspot will be partially closed for construction of an ADA accessible toilet at the Memorial Field bathroom beginning Monday, August 31, 2020.

To minimize disruption to the playground, the pavilion area and back swing set will be cordoned off while leaving access to the remainder of the playground.
