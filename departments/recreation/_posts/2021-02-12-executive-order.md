title: Executive Order Loosening Sports Restrictions
---

As you may be aware, Governor Murphy has issued an Executive Order loosening restrictions on indoor sports. However this Order also gives municipalities discretion over how to roll this out safely and fairly.

In coordination with the Board of Education, we are working towards assessing gym capacity and how to implement the Executive Order so that it works for Rutherford’s facilities.

Although the Executive Order states this is effective immediately, the Borough feels the timing does not allow us to responsibly implement the directives outlined in it.

**There will be no parents, guardians or other spectators permitted at this weekend’s Recreation basketball games. Current protocols remain in effect until a full assessment of the Executive Order can be completed by the Borough and Board of Education.**

Meetings will take place between the Borough and Board of Education early next week to coordinate the appropriate steps needed to comply with the Executive Order.
