The Rutherford Municipal Alliance and Rutherford Recreation Department
invite you to observe the third annual **Family Night on Wednesday, June 14.**
Simply put, just enjoy spending time with your family!

The purpose of Family Night is to provide Rutherford families with
a cleared schedule to enjoy quality time with each other.


Unplug from distractions and spend an uninterrupted
evening with your family with activities such as board games, a
family walk, a trip out for ice cream or researching family history.
No youth recreation programs have been scheduled during Family Night.
Rutherford students will also have a night free of homework.


Organized by the Rutherford Recreation Department.
