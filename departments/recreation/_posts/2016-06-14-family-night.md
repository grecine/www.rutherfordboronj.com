In continuing the Municipal Allianceâ€™s observance of the first annual 
Family Night last year, the Rutherford Recreation Department invites all Rutherford 
families to participate in the second annual Family Night on Thursday, June 16.  
Simply put, just spend time with your family!

The purpose of Family Night is to provide Rutherford families with 
a cleared schedule to enjoy quality time with each other.  
Unplug from distractions and spend an uninterrupted 
evening with your family with activities such as board games, a 
family walk, a trip out for ice cream or researching family history.

No youth recreation programs have been scheduled during Family Night. 
With the exception of our high school students who need to study for exams, 
Rutherford students will also have a night free of homework.

Organized by the Rutherford Recreation Department. 
Please email barbarab@rutherfordboronj.com 
to share how you spent Family Night!
