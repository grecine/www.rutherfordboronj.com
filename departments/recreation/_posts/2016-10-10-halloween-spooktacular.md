The Rutherford Recreation Department and Halloween Spooktacular Committee have planned a fun-filled third annual Halloween Spooktacular for our Rutherford children on Sunday, October 30! Looking forward to seeing you there! 

Please help provide a fun Trunk or Treat event to our Rutherford children! Rutherford Rec and our Halloween Spooktacular Committee are seeking decorated cars/vehicles for the event. There's plenty of time to come up with fun, creative, spooky or cute themes to decorate your car/vehicle. Don't miss out on the chance to help provide a fun way to bring our community together to help celebrate Halloween with our children. Trophies will be presented to the Top 3 best decorated cars! Please register your space by calling the Rec Office at 201-460-3015.
