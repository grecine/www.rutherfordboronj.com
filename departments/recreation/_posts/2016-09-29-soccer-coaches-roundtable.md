**Soccer Coaches Roundtable Session**

**Tuesday, October 4th 8 p.m.**

**Diamond 2 at Memorial Park**


The Rutherford Recreation Department will host a Soccer Coaches Roundtable Session next week. This event will serve as a follow-up to the mandatory Soccer Coaches Clinic held on September 1. In continuing his efforts to assist Rutherford Rec/Rutherford FC Travel Soccer coaches, RHS Boys Varsity Soccer Coach John Randazzo will run another roundtable session for Rec/Travel Soccer Coaches on Tuesday, October 4 at 8 p.m. at Memorial Park’s Diamond 2.

This roundtable session will be an opportunity to share activities, demo training session structure, learn Coach Randazzo’s philosophy of player development, and continue to foster open communication among soccer coaches.

The Rutherford Recreation Department thanks Coach Randazzo for serving as a resource during our 2016 Soccer season.
