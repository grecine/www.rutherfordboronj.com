title: "Free Rabies Clinic 4/6"

---

The Rutherford Health Department will be conducting its Annual Free Rabies Clinic for Rutherford cats and
dogs on **Saturday, April 6, 2019 from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM at the Mortimer Avenue Firehouse** located at the
corner of Mortimer Avenue and West Pierrepont Avenue. 

Registration forms can be picked up, in advance of
the Clinic, at the Health Department located at 184 Park Avenue, between 8:30 AM and 4:30 PM weekdays or
at Police Headquarters after normal working hours. All cats and dogs must be accompanied by an adult and
restrained on a leash or in a carrier. The vaccine to be administered at the Rabies Clinic is approved for a 3-year
duration of immunity for cats and dogs 12 months of age or older who have been previously vaccinated. Cats
and dogs vaccinated in the age of three (3) months to eleven (11) months will require revaccination one (1) year
subsequently, in addition to those animals over 12 months with no history of previous rabies vaccination.

IF AN ANIMAL HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY VACCINATED, PROOF OF THE PRIOR
IMMUNIZATION WILL BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO RECEIVE A 3-YEAR VACCINATION
CERTIFICATE AT THE RABIES CLINIC.

The State Health Department encourages those owners of animals whose vaccination expires next year to be
vaccinated this year to insure a good overlap in immunity. This will prevent pet owners from missing the 3-
year re-vaccination date, causing their pets vaccination to expire. A member of the Police Department will also
be present during the course of the Rabies Clinic so that unlicensed dogs and cats can be registered by their
owners after receiving the Rabies Vaccination.
