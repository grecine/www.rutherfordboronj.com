**The Rutherford Health Department will be conducting two Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Programs for residents during
the third and fourth weeks in October.**

It is important to note that the Health Department is required to advertise the seasonal influenza vaccination program
far in advance of actually receiving the vaccine. While the Health Department expects to receive its 400 doses of the
seasonal influenza vaccine before the October program dates, residents should call the 24-hour hot line number
starting on Monday, October 19, 2020 to insure that all of the vaccine has been received.

The first seasonal influenza vaccination program is **ONLY** for residents 65 years of age and older and will be held on
Friday, October 23, 2020 between the hours of 4:30 PM to 6:30 PM. Proof of age will be required to be provided and no
one under 65 years of age will be vaccinated at this program.

A second seasonal influenza vaccination program will also be held on Tuesday, October 27, 2020, between 8:30 A.M. to
10:30 A.M., for all adult residents 18 years and older.

**Residents should be aware of the following due to COVID-19 concerns:**

1- Seating is NOT available and those who have difficulty standing are encouraged to arrive one hour after
the start of the program.

2- Residents will be required to social distance (6 feet apart) outside the health department and wear a face
covering. Residents are asked to bring their own pen to fill out the consent form.

3- A limited number of participants will be allowed in the health center at any given time.

4- No one should attend the program if they have been ill within the past 48 hours.

5- Residents will be required to complete a “CDC Facilities COVID-19 Screening” form prior to entering
health center.

Both programs will be held at the Rutherford Health Department, 184 Park Avenue, Rutherford, New Jersey.
Four hundred (400) doses of vaccine are available for the programs and will be provided on a first come first serve basis
until the vaccine supply is depleted. Residents 65 years of age and older are required to bring their Medicare I.D.
Card.

The Rutherford Health Department has set up a 24-hour hot line number, which can be accessed at 201-460-3000 x 3154,
to obtain more information on the planned Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Clinics. Residents who have questions not
answered by the 24-hour hot line number can call the Health Department weekdays at 201-460-3020.
