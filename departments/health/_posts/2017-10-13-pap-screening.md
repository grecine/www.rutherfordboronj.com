title: "Pap Screening Program"
---


**The Rutherford Health Department will sponsor a Pap Screening Program which
includes a breast and pelvic exam and a cervical smear for a Pap Test starting at 4:00
PM on Wednesday, November 8, 2017.**

Appointments are required. 

The Screening will be held at the Health Center, 184 Park Avenue, and is a community service for eligible
residents. Eligibility is contingent on being 18 years of age or older, those who have
not had a Pap Test within one year, and not under the care of a Gynecologist for a
specific illness. 

There will be a reduced fee of $35.00 which will cover the laboratory
analysis of the thin prep pap test. Consetta Cheatam, who has volunteered her services,
will be conducting the screening program. For further information on this program and
to make an appointment please contact the Public Health Nurses at 201-460-3020,
between the hours of 1:00 P.M. to 4:00 P.M., Monday through Friday.
