**The text below can also be heard at the Health Department’s 24-Hour Hotline at 201-460-3154**

This message is designed to give residents some detailed information about the state’s vaccination program regarding COVID-19.

At this time, the state is vacating the following individuals: health care workers, long-term care facility residents and staff, Police, Fire, EMS, individuals at high risk, such as those aged 65 years of age and older and individuals ages 16 to 64 with medical conditions that increase the risk of severe illness from the virus.

These conditions include: Cancer, chronic kidney disease, Down syndrome, heart conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathies, obesity, sickle cell disease, smoking, type 2 diabetes.

The state plans on setting up six mega vaccination clinics throughout the state, one of which will be at the Meadowlands Race Track in East Rutherford, NJ. It is also anticipated that pharmacies, such as Walgreens, CVS, Shop Rite, etc., will also be vaccinating people. It is not anticipated that our department will be vaccinating residents against COVID-19.

Timing of the progression among the groups noted is dependent on the supply of the vaccine provided to the state and balanced by the demands in each group noted above.

More detailed information is available off the State Health Department COVID-19 information hub web site, which can be accessed at www.covid19.nj.gov . 

Residents who have questions not answered by the 24-Hour Hotline Number can
call the Health Department weekdays at 201-460-3020.

Thank you.
