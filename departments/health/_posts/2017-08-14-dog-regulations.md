title: "Dog Regulations"
---


The Rutherford Health Department reminds residents that under Borough Ordinance, dogs are
prohibited from being at large or on a leash in any of the Borough’s playgrounds, recreation areas,
park lands, and sport fields. With the fall schedule of sporting activities coming up in the near
future, it is imperative that dog owners fully cooperate with the rules and regulations governing
dogs that are in place. Violators can be subject to a fine up to $200.00.


Additionally, all dogs are required to be leashed when off the owner’s property, licensed annually
through the Police Department Records Bureau, and walked in compliance with the provisions of
the Borough’s Pooper Scooper Ordinance.


Borough Officials intend to actively enforce the regulations prohibiting dogs on all playgrounds,
recreation areas, park lands, and sport fields. The cooperation of all dog owners is requested to
protect the health and safety of those residents using Rutherford’s public recreation facilities.
