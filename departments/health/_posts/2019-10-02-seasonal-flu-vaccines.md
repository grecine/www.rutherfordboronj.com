title: "Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Programs"

---
The Rutherford Health Department will be conducting two Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Programs for
residents during the months of October & November.

It is important to note that the Health Department is required to advertise the seasonal influenza
vaccination program far in advance of actually receiving the vaccine. While the Health Department
expects to receive its 400 doses of the seasonal influenza vaccine before the October program dates,
residents should call the 24-hour hot line number during the week of October 21, 2019 to insure that
all of the vaccine has been received.

**The first seasonal influenza vaccination program is ONLY for residents 65 years of age and older and
will be held on Tuesday, October 22, 2019 between the hours of 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM.** Proof of age will
be required to be provided and no one under 65 years of age will be vaccinated at this program.

**A second seasonal influenza vaccination program will also be held on Friday, November 1, 2019
between 4:30 P.M. to 6:30 P.M., for all adult residents 18 years and older, especially high risk persons,
household contact of high risk persons, health care workers, those that provide essential community
services, and other adults who wish to decrease their risk of influenza.**

Seating is NOT available and those who have difficulty in standing are encouraged to arrive one
hour after the start of the program. No appointments are required for either program date.
Both programs will be held at the Rutherford Health Department, 184 Park Avenue, Rutherford, New
Jersey.

Four hundred (400) doses of vaccine are available for the programs and will be provided on a first come
first serve basis until the vaccine supply is depleted. Residents 65 years of age and older are required
to bring their Medicare I.D. Card.

The Rutherford Health Department has set up a 24-hour hot line number which can be accessed at 201-
460-3000 x 3154, to obtain more information on the planned Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Clinics.
Residents who have questions not answered by the 24-hour hot line number can call the Health
Department weekdays at 201-460-3020.
