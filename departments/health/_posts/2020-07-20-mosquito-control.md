From the County of Bergen Department of Public Works/Mosquito Control Division:

Bergen County Mosquito Control has been receiving substantial amounts of residential complaints from Rutherford residents about mosquitoes. The mosquitoes are coming from resident’s yards who are accidentally breeding mosquitoes by not removing their standing water in their yards. We would like to spray larvicide from our truck mounted units in your town – this Friday, July 24th between the hours of 4-6 AM. Attached to this email is the label and safety data sheets for the material we are using in addition to a map of the area being treated.

Please see documentation below regarding the larvicide spray:
