Rutherford Borough Officials have been advised by the Bergen County Mosquito Control (BCMC) that they have been receiving substantial amounts of residential complaints from Rutherford residents about mosquitoes. BCMC believes the mosquitoes are coming from the residentâ€™s yards who are accidentally breeding mosquitoes by not removing stagnant water in their yard. 

**The BCMC plans on spraying a larvicide from truck mounted units in the borough on Friday, July 24, 2020 between the hours of 4 AM to 6 AM, to reduce the volume of future adult mosquitoes.** 

The product to be used is an EPA registered biological larvicide and will be applied according to the EPA label directions.

A fact sheet for the VectoBac Biological Larvicide and Safety Data Sheet are noted below.

Residents with questions can reach out to the Rutherford Health Department weekdays at
