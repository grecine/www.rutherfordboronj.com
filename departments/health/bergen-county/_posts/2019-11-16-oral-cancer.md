title: "Oral Cancer When a Sore Won’t Go Away"
---


Cancers of the mouth and throat are the sixth most common type of cancer worldwide. These cancers are often not detected until Stage III or Stage IV, reducing the individual’s chance for a cure. This Tuesday, November 19th Bergen New Bridge Medical Center (BNBMC), a clinical affiliate of Rutgers, will be hosting, “Oral Cancer When a Sore Won’t Go Away” that will be held in their auditorium located at 230 East Ridgewood Avenue, Paramus, NJ. 

 

The program will include the opportunity for individuals to be screened for oral cancer from 5:00 to 6:00 pm and from 7:00 to 8:00 pm, and features a presentation from 6:00 to 7:00 pm by Mina Le, MD, a head and neck surgeon subspecializing in mouth and throat cancer who joined the medical staff at Bergen New Bridge Medical Center as part of the Rutgers Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery in 2018. Dr. Le is a board-certified otolaryngologist who completed a fellowship in head and neck oncologic surgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.  Dr. Le will discuss the risk factors for throat and mouth cancer and share the early symptoms and signs.

 

Light refreshments will be served and there’s still time to register for this Tuesday’s FREE program.

According to the Oral Cancer Foundation, approximately 53,000 individuals in the United States will be newly diagnosed with oral or oropharyngeal (throat) cancer in 2019, with 132 individuals newly diagnosed with an oral cancer in the United States EVERY DAY. It will cause over 9,750 deaths, killing roughly 1 person per hour, 24 hours per day.  

 

Unfortunately, Oral Cancer Awareness in the American public is low.  An oral cancer screening/examination can detect early signs of cancer.  Visual inspection by dentists and physicians can often detect premalignant abnormalities and cancer at an early stage, when treatment may be less extensive and more successful.  The exam is painless and takes only a few minutes. 

 

Attached is a promotional flyers for this event to network quickly to your personal and professional contacts, particularly those individuals who would benefit from increasing their awareness of this cancer.
