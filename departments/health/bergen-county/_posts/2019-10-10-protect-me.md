Vaccinating children before they are exposed to serious and life-threatening diseases is the best way to protect them.  The Partnership for Maternal and Child Health of Northern New Jersey, in collaboration with the New Jersey Department of Health, is hosting the eighth annual Protect Me With 3+ adolescent poster and video contest. The contest raises awareness about the importance of adolescent immunizations among preteens, teens and parents to increase vaccination rates for: Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (Tdap), Human Papillomavirus (HPV), Meningococcal Conjugate), and Flu vaccination.

 

The contest involves New Jersey middle school and high school students, in grades five through 12, who are encouraged to create informational posters and videos about key vaccinations. Contest guidelines can be viewed at www.protectmewith3.com.  The website also provides activities and tools for teachers to incorporate the contest into lesson plans.

 

Entries for this year's contest will be accepted through January 26, 2020. Following the final submission deadline, the top five submissions in each category will be posted on the Protect Me With 3+ website for public voting. Public voting on the top submissions will be available on the website from March 23rd  through April 5th. The top three winners in each category and the classroom with the most eligible entries will receive awards and all finalists will be formally acknowledged at an awards ceremony in April 2020.  Winnersâ€™ posters and videos will also be displayed at health events statewide. Students who submit by the early bird deadline will also be entered into a separate drawing to win even more prizes!

 

Additionally, copies of posters, tent cards, and adolescent reminder/recall postcards featuring artwork from prior winners are available at no cost upon request. To request educational materials, please call 609-826-4861. For more information, please visit www.protectmewith3.com.

 

Attached are 3 promotional flyers (individually for middle, high, and combined middle/high school students) to post/network to your personal and professional contacts, particularly students/teachers in the community.

 

The Bergen-Hudson Chronic Disease Coalition, administered by the Bergen County Department of Health Services, and grant-funded from the New Jersey Department of Health Office of Cancer Control and Prevention (OCCP), dedicated to the prevention of chronic diseases and working towards increasing rates for HPV immunization, encourages students, teachers and parents to participate in this contest.  The Protect Me With 3+ contest is a great tool for raising student and parent awareness about the importance of adolescent vaccination and increasing vaccination rates.

 

Educating students about the benefits of adolescent vaccination can help prevent the spread of serious and potentially deadly diseases.
