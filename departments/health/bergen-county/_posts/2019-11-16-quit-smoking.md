The American Cancer Society’s Great American Smokeout® is an annual event held on the Thursday before Thanksgiving that encourages smokers to make a plan to quit, or plan in advance and initiate a smoking cessation plan on this special day.  Successfully quitting tobacco is a matter of planning and commitment, not luck.  According to the American Cancer Society, research shows that individuals who select a quit day that’s within the next 30 days and stick to it, they’ll be more likely to succeed in quitting.  Here is a great opportunity to get an early start and prepare for this special smoking cessation day.
