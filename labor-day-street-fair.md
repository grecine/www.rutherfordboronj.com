The 43rd Annual Rutherford Labor Day Street Fair which historically attracts 25,000 – 30,000 attendees is now not only the oldest annual street fair in the Garden State but also the largest one-day street festival in the state. 

In addition to the traditional street vendors, food trucks and antique fair, the event now includes rides and entertainment for kids, walk around street performers including a stilt walker, balloon artist, jugglers and an array of variety entertainers along with an assortment of amusements to keep the kids entertained and attract young families. 

The event’s lineup of live musical acts includes Rutherford resident Lise Avery, host of the internationally syndicated WFDU show, "Anything Goes." Lise will once again open the Labor Day Street Fair, as she has for the past few years. Lise plays music from the 40s through current music on her Monday morning FM program. 

Jersey Sound will perform oldies and classic rock favorites and also performing will be Rutherford’s own Luke and the Troublemakers.

**Street Closures and No Parking will enforced from the areas of Lincoln Park to the Train Station beginning at 6am on September 2nd.**
