[Read a message from Rutherford Board of Education regarding closures here.](https://www.rutherfordschools.org/blog/school-closure-distance-learning/)

A message from Mayor Frank Nunziato:

**55 Kip Center,** which serves the senior citizen population of Rutherford and the greater Bergen County area has closed as a precautionary measure to in order combat the spread of COVID-19 (Coronavirus). This closure is effective immediately (March 12th at 4:30) and will continue until March 27th unless data at that time suggests further closure is advisable.

The Rutherford Board of Health would like to remind people that the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions seem to be at higher risk for more serious COVID-19 illness. 

Early data suggest older people are twice as likely to have serious COVID-19 because:

- As people age, their immune systems change, making it harder for their body to fight off diseases and infection

- Many older adults are also more likely to have underlying health conditions that make it harder to cope with and recover from illness

 - If you are at increased risk for COVID 19 complications due to age or a severe underlying medical condition, it is especially important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of exposure

55 Kip Center management, the Rutherford Board of Health, Council Liaison McGowan and myself feel this closure is a critical step in safeguarding the health of not only our senior citizen population but also the population at large. 

Any client that is part of the Homefriends Program can continue to request services and staff will get back to them within 24 hours of their request. Any other concerns or help that members may need including meals will be addressed as well. Staff will be checking phone messages daily throughout this closure period. 

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter. 

Mayor Frank Nunziato
