The Rutherford Farmer’s Market is returning for its 21st season. The market is sponsored this year by the Borough of Rutherford. The governing body welcomes the opportunity to support regional farmers by allowing them to market quality products in our downtown area.  To remain competitive, farmers need to be able to develop new markets for agricultural products grown on their farms. These markets provide the economic activity necessary to help preserve farmland and open space, which in turn contributes to a better quality of life in our region.  Our borough benefits because market patrons have access to fresh, high quality produce and our local businesses enjoy increased business activity.
