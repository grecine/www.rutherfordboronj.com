Recycling and Reducing Waste in Rutherford
Confused about what you can and can't recycle? Worried about the impact of China's decision
to stop accepting American recyclables? Wondering what you can do to decrease your
household waste?

**Come to a free, one-hour Rutherford Green Team workshop on Reducing and Recycling,
Tuesday, July 17 at 6:45 pm in Rutherford Public Library, 150 Park Avenue, Rutherford.**

DPW Head Chris Seidler and Green Team members will explain the current crisis in recycling
nationwide, which has been exacerbated by China's "National Sword" policy, and how it impacts
Rutherford residents.

Attendees will learn exactly what can and can't be recycled in Rutherford, how to prepare waste
for the recycling bin, and how to avoid having your recycling end up as trash. Photos and
videos will be shown of what happens to Rutherford's recycling. Information will be provided
about recycling large and hazardous items and alternate ways of disposing of waste. There will
also be discussion of various methods of waste reduction.
