---

**The Borough of Rutherford is pleased to announce that Rutherford’s annual fireworks display will be held on Sunday, June 30, 2019 at Memorial Field. Activities start at 7:00 PM with music by the classic rock cover band Yosemite. Food and drinks will be sold by Rutherford Junior Football and Cheer to benefit their program.  The fireworks display will begin at approximately 9:15 PM.**  

Visitors are reminded to bring lawn chairs or blankets for their own comfort and to leave their pets at home. Pets are not allowed in borough parks.  For residents’ safety, the following items are prohibited at the fireworks display or on any part of Memorial Field: coolers, backpacks, fireworks (including sparklers), alcoholic beverages and drones.  Bags will be subject to search. 

A reunification meeting place for lost children has been designated at the fire truck with the green flashing light stationed at the intersection of Darwin and Yahara Avenues. Those attending the fireworks should advise all in their party of the reunification site in the event of separation from their group. Limited port-a-john facilities will be available at Darwin Avenue and Monona Avenue.

For our festivities, Memorial Field, including Tryon Field, will be closed on the day of the event. Since nearby streets will close for the celebration, residents are discouraged from travelling to the site via automobile.  A non-vehicle traffic perimeter will be established from Grand Avenue and West Erie Avenue, extending south to Hobart Avenue and west on Hobart Avenue to Riverside Avenue.  Handicapped parking will be available on West Erie Avenue (from Jackson to Grand Avenues) on the north side of the street by the community garden.
