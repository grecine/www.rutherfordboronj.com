Rutherford Volunteer Fire Department

HELP US PAVE THE WAY TO

Revitalize Firemen’s Park

Buying a Brick is an opportunity for you to leave a lasting imprint of your support of the
Rutherford Fire Department. Purchasing a paver brick engraved with your family’s name,
anniversary, the name of a loved one, or the name of your business, will enable us to revitalize
Firemen’s Park. 

The bricks will be used to form the walkway around the monument.

All Bricks are 4” x 8” $ 55.00
