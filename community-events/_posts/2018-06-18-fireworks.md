Visitors are reminded to bring lawn chairs or blankets for their own comfort and to leave their
pets at home. Pets are not allowed in borough parks. For residents’ safety, the following items
are prohibited at the fireworks display or on any part of Memorial Field: coolers, backpacks,
fireworks (including sparklers), alcoholic beverages and drones. Bags will be subject to search.

A reunification meeting place for lost children has been designated at the fire truck with the
green flashing light stationed at the intersection of Darwin and Yahara Avenues. Those attending
the fireworks should advise all in their party of the reunification site in the event of separation
from their group. Limited port-a-john facilities will be available at Darwin Avenue and Monona
Avenue.

For our festivities, Memorial Field will close at 10:00 AM on the day of the event. Since streets
will be closed for the celebration, residents are discouraged from travelling to the site via
automobile. A non-vehicle traffic perimeter will be established from Grand Avenue and West
Erie Avenue, extending south to Hobart Avenue and west on Hobart Avenue to Riverside
Avenue. Handicapped parking will be available on West Erie Avenue (from Jackson to Grand
Avenues) on the north side of the street by the community garden.
