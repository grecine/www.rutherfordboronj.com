            When dining out, it is strongly recommended that you make reservations so that our restaurants can better prepare for their
            evening. Please remember that business owners, staff and patrons are all creating a new normal as this chapter of reopening
            begins. Be respectful and patient with each other!</p>
        <p>
            All participating businesses will comply with the regulations outlined by the Governorâ€™s Executive Order and the NJ Department of Health.
